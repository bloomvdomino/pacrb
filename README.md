# pacrb

Generates and auto-updates a pacman repository.

Heavily inspired by [aur-build-server](https://github.com/ullebe1/aur-build-server) from [ullebe1](https://github.com/ullebe1).

## Installation

### Initialize the repo

docker exec -it -u root [CONTAINER_NAME] install -d /var/cache/pacman/[REPO_NAME] -o build
docker exec -it -u root [CONTAINER_NAME] repo-add /var/cache/pacman/[REPO_NAME]/[REPO_NAME].db.tar.gz
docker exec -it -u root [CONTAINER_NAME] chown -R build:build /var/cache/pacman/[REPO_NAME]

## Usage

You can use the following commands to add or remove a package.

### Add a package to pacrb

```
docker exec -it -u build [CONTAINER_NAME] aur sync -d [REPO_NAME] --root /var/cache/pacman/[REPO_NAME] -ncT --noview [PACKAGE_NAME]
```

### Remove a package from pacrb

```
docker exec -it -u build [CONTAINER_NAME] repo-remove /var/cache/pacman/[REPO_NAME]/[REPO_NAME].db.tar [PACKAGE_NAME(S)]
```

## What's remaining to sayâ€¦

This README isn't finished yet, it will be improved in future. This project is in alpha state for now. There are some instructions in the `Dockerfile` considered to be unsafe, which will be hopefully changed to more secure instructions in the near future.
